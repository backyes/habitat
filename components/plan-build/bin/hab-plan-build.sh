# $ hab-plan-build [<PATH>]
# ```
#
# # Synopsis
#
# `hab-plan-build` handles creating Habitat packages from Plan files.
#
# # plan.sh
#
# The heart of `hab-plan-build` is the Plan. This file is a shell
# script which defines how you download, configure, make, install,
# and run software. Think of it as a cross between an rpm `spec` file
# and a `Dockerfile`.
#
# Here is an example `plan.sh` for [zlib](http://www.zlib.net/) - it
# also happens to be the smallest possible `plan.sh`:
#
# ```sh
# pkg_name=zlib
# pkg_description="The zlib library"
# pkg_upstream_url=http://zlib.net
# pkg_maintainer="Frank Lloyd Wright <flw@example.com>"
# pkg_version=1.2.8
# pkg_license=('zlib')
# pkg_source=http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/libpng/$pkg_name/${pkg_version}/${pkg_name}-${pkg_version}.tar.gz
# pkg_filename=${pkg_name}-${pkg_version}.tar.gz
# pkg_shasum=36658cb768a54c1d4dec43c3116c27ed893e88b02ecfcb44f2166f9c0b7f2a0d
# pkg_deps=(glibc)
# pkg_lib_dirs=(lib)
# pkg_include_dirs=(include)
# ```
#
# It has the name of the software, the version, where to download it, a
# checksum to verify the contents are what we expect, an origin key to sign the
# resulting package with, a single dependency on glibc, and it has the
# resulting libraries in `lib` and header files in `include`.
#
# When executed, this program will:
#
# 1. Download the software
# 1. Validate the checksum
# 1. Uncompress it
# 1. Set the build environment to depend on the `glibc` package
# 1. Run `./configure && make`
# 1. Run `make install`
# 1. Write out the data other packages need to depend on `zlib`
# 1. Create a libsodium-signed tarball of the results
#
# ## Plan Options
#
# ### pkg_name
# Sets the name of the package.
# ```
# pkg_name=zlib
# ```
#
# ### pkg_description
# A short description of the package.
# ```
# pkg_description="The zlib library"
# ```
# This is rendered as markdown, so use a bash heredoc to insert a block of text that will be displayed on the web site. Be careful with escaping special characters, it's bash after all!
#```
# pkg_description=$(cat <<EOF
# This is a multiline description.
# \`\`\`
# % echo "Maybe it has code examples?"
# \`\`\`
# Build a happy Habitat!
# EOF
# )
#```
#

# The URL to the upstream project's website or home page.
# ```
# pkg_upstream_url=http://zlib.net
# ```
#

# the source is local to the `plan.sh`, then omit this value.
# ```
# pkg_source=http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/libpng/$pkg_name/${pkg_version}/${pkg_name}-${pkg_version}.tar.gz
# ```
#
# ### pkg_filename
# The resulting filename for the download.
# ```
# pkg_filename=${pkg_name}-${pkg_version}.tar.gz
# ```
#
# ### pkg_shasum
# The sha256 sum of for the externally downloaded `$pkg_source`, if used. You
# can easily generate by downloading the source and using `sha256sum` or
# `gsha256sum`.
# ```
# pkg_shasum=36658cb768a54c1d4dec43c3116c27ed893e88b02ecfcb44f2166f9c0b7f2a0d
# ```
#
#
# ### pkg_deps
# An array of the package dependencies needed at runtime.
# ```
# pkg_deps=(glibc pcre openssl zlib)
# ```
#
# ### pkg_build_deps
# An array of the package dependencies needed only at build time.
# ```
# pkg_build_deps=(linux-headers)
# ```
#
# ### pkg_lib_dirs
# An array of paths, relative to the final install of the software, where
# libraries can be found. Used to populate `LD_FLAGS` and `LD_RUN_PATH` for
# software that depends on your package.
# ```
# pkg_lib_dirs=(lib)
# ```
#
# ### pkg_include_dirs
# An array of paths, relative to the final install of the software, where
# headers can be found. Used to populate `CFLAGS`, `CPPFLAGS` and `CXXFLAGS`
# for software that depends on your package.
# ```
# pkg_include_dirs=(include)
# ```
#
# ### pkg_bin_dirs
# An array of paths, relative to the final install of the software, where
# binaries can be found. Used to populate `PATH` for software that depends on
# your package.
# ```
# pkg_bin_dirs=(bin)
# ```
#
# ### pkg_pconfig_dirs
# An array of paths, relative to the final install of the software,
# where pkg-config metadata (.pc files) can be found.  Used to populate
# PKG_CONFIG_PATH for software that depends on your package.
# ```
# pkg_pconfig_dirs=(lib/pkgconfig)
# ```
#
# ### pkg_svc_run
# The command to start the service, if needed. Should not fork!
# ```
# pkg_svc_run="haproxy -f $pkg_svc_config_path/haproxy.conf"
# ```
#
# ### pkg_exports
# An associative array representing configuration data which should be gossiped to peers. The keys
# in this array represent the name the value will be assigned and the values represent the toml path
# to read the value.
# ```
# pkg_exports=(
#   [key]=token
#   [port]=server.port
#   [host]=server.host
# )
# ```
#
# ### pkg_exposes
# An array of `pkg_exports` keys containing default values for which ports that this package
# exposes. These values are used as sensible defaults for other tools. For example, when exporting
# a package to a container format.
# ```
# pkg_exposes=(port)
# ```
#
# ### pkg_binds
# An associative array representing services which you depend on and the configuration keys that
# you expect the service to export (by their `pkg_exports`). These binds *must* be set for the
# Supervisor to load the service. The loaded service will wait to run until its bind becomes
# available. If the bind does not contain the expected keys, the service will not start
# successfully.
# ```
# pkg_binds=(
#   [database]="port host"
# )
#
# ### pkg_binds_optional
# Same as `pkg_binds` but these represent optional services to connect to.
# ```
# pkg_binds_optional=(
#   [storage]="port host"
# )
#
# ### pkg_origin
# A string to use for the origin. The origin is used to denote a particular upstream of a
# package; when we resolve dependencies, we consider a version of a package to be equal
# regardless of its origin - but you can specify what you prefer to use.
# ```
# pkg_origin=acme
# ```
#
# ### pkg_interpreters
# An array of interpreters used in shebang lines for scripts. Specify
# the subdirectory where the binary is relative to the package, e.g.,
# `bin/bash` or `libexec/neverland`, since binaries can be located in
# directories besides `bin`. This list of interpreters will be written
# to the metadata INTERPRETERS file with their fully-qualified path.
# Then these can be used with the `fix_interpreter` function in this script.
# ```
# pkg_interpreters=(bin/bash bin/sh)
# ```
#
# ## Plan variables
#
# `hab-plan-build` sets a few useful variables for you, in addition to the ones
# you define above. They are:
#
# * `$pkg_prefix`: This variable is the final path for your package.
# * `$pkg_dirname`: Set to `${pkg_name}-${pkg_version}` by default
# * `$pkg_svc_path`: Where the running service is; `$HAB_ROOT_PATH/svc/$pkg_name`
# * `$pkg_svc_data_path`: Service data; `$pkg_svc_path/data`
# * `$pkg_svc_files_path`: Gossiped config files; `$pkg_svc_path/files`
# * `$pkg_svc_var_path`: Variable state; `$pkg_svc_path/var`
# * `$pkg_svc_config_path`: Configuration; `$pkg_svc_path/config`
# * `$pkg_svc_static_path`: Static content; `$pkg_svc_path/static`
# * `$HAB_CACHE_SRC_PATH`: The path to all the externally downloaded package
#      sources
# * `$HAB_CACHE_ARTIFACT_PATH`: The default download root path for package
#      artifacts, used on package installation
# * `$HAB_CACHE_KEY_PATH`: The path where cryptographic keys are stored
# * `$CFLAGS`: C compiler options
# * `$LDFLAGS`: C linker options
# * `$PREFIX`: Where to install the software; same as $pkg_prefix
# * `$LD_RUN_PATH`: Where to find binaries at run time
#
# ## Plan Callbacks (Build Phases)
#
# `hab-plan-build` allows you to alter its behavior by defining callbacks (or build phases)
# within the `plan.sh`. While `zlib` is awesome and requires no callbacks, most
# software isn't quite so simple to build. To define a callback, simply create
# a shell function with its name - then write out your script.
#
# Most likely, you simply need to redefine two steps:
#
# 1. do_build - this step runs './configure --prefix=$pkg_prefix && make`.
# 1. do_install - this step runs `make install`.
#
# Here is an example `plan.sh` for `haproxy`, which overrides both:
#
# ```sh
# pkg_name=haproxy
# pkg_version=1.5.12
# pkg_license=('BSD')
# pkg_maintainer="Frank Lloyd Wright <flw@example.com>"
# pkg_source=http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.5/src/${pkg_name}-${pkg_version}.tar.gz
# pkg_filename=${pkg_name}-${pkg_version}.tar.gz
# pkg_shasum=6648dd7d6b958d83dd7101eab5792178212a66c884bec0ebcd8abc39df83bb78
# pkg_bin_dirs=(bin)
# pkg_deps=(glibc pcre openssl zlib)
# pkg_svc_run="haproxy -f $pkg_svc_config_path/haproxy.conf"
# pkg_exposes=(port)
# pkg_exports=(
#   [mode]=mode
#   [port]=server.port
# )
#
# do_build() {
#   make USE_PCRE=1 \
#     USE_PCRE_JIT=1 \
#     CPU=x86_64 \
#     TARGET=linux2628 \
#     USE_OPENSSL=1 \
#     USE_ZLIB=1 \
#     ADDINC="$CFLAGS" \
#     ADDLIB="$LDFLAGS"
# }
#
# do_install() {
#   mkdir -p $pkg_prefix/bin
#   cp haproxy $pkg_prefix/bin
# }
# ```
#
# [A complete list of callbacks, their description, and attendant source code,
# is but a click away.](#build-phases)

# ## Private/Internal helper functions
#
# These functions are part of the private/internal API of this program and
# should **not** be used externally by Plan authors or other programs. Their
# behaviors and names can change with little to no warning and no direct
# support can be provided as a result. Thank you for your
# understanding--maintaining a tiny but robust public interface is not an easy
# task.

# **Internal** Handles exiting the program on signals. Takes either an argument
# with the status code, or uses the last command's status code.

# For example, the below would exit with a status of 1.
#
# ```bash
# _on_exit 1
# ```
#
# Or:
#
# ```bash
# false

# ```
